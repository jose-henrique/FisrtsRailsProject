# This is my first project with Ruby on Rails

My idea for this project is to create a blog following the get started guide on [official site](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) of rails, and add more features, to increase my learning about ruby on rails.

the first steps have been taken:
- [x] Create article controller, and views.
- [x] Create comments controllers and views.

Now the features that i want to add:
- [ ] User authentication system, with encrypted passowrd.
- [ ] Like and dislike system.
- [ ] stylize all pages.

and the last step
- [ ] deploy apllication on heroku.
