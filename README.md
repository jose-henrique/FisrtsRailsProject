# This is my first project with Ruby on Rails

My idea for this project is to create a blog following the get started guide on [official site](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) of rails, and add more features, to increase my learning about ruby on rails.


the first steps have been taken:
- [x] Create article controller, and views.
- [x] Create comments controllers and views.

Now the features that i want to add:
- [X] User authentication system, with encrypted passowrd.
- [x] Add owners To Articles
- [ ] User Permissions.
- [ ] stylize all pages.

and the last step(if possible)
- [ ] deploy apllication on heroku.

if I don't get it, i did my best :)
